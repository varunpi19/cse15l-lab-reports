# Gita Verse 6.20-6.23

*When the mind, absolutely restrained by the practice of concentration, attains quietitude, and when seeing the Self by the self, one is satisfied in his own Self; when he feels that infinite bliss- which is perceived by the (purified) intellect and which transcends the senses, and established wherein he never departs from his real state; and having obtained which, regards no other acquisition superior to that, and where established, he is not moved even by heavy sorrow; let that be known as the state, called by the name of Yoga- a state of severance from the contact of pain. This yoga should be practiced with perseverance, undisturbed by depression of heart*

## Who Am I?

**When other thoughts arise, one should not pursue them, but should inquire: 'To whom do they arise?' It does not matter how many thoughts arise. As each thought arises, one should inquire with diligence, "To whom has this thought arisen?". The answer that would emerge would be "To me". Thereupon if one inquires "Who am I?", the mind will go back to its source; and the thought that arose will become quiescent. With repeated practice in this manner, the mind will develop the skill to stay in its source.**
